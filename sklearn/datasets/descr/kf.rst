This is a synthetic dataset generated by Pieter Abbeel for his Fall 2011 class
on Robotics at University of California, Berkeley.  It consists of 500
measurements 2D measurements for a robot with a 5D state space.  Data was
generated by sampling from the following generative model,

  x_{t+1} = A * x_t + b_t + e_t^1
  z_{t}   = C * x_t + d_t + e_t^2
  e_t^1   ~ MultivariateNormal(0, Q)
  e_t^2   ~ MultivariateNormal(0, R)
  x_0     ~ MultivariateNormal(x_0, V_0)

This dataset contains the observations, true hidden states, parameters of the initial state distribution, hidden states estimated by the Kalman Filter, hidden states estimated by the Kalman Smoother, and covariance matrices estimated after 50 EM iterations.

The contents are based on the contents of 'p4_starter/p4_a_data.mat' from the
following zip file,

  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa11/ps2/p4_starter_v2.zip

variables not found in the mentioned mat file have been generated by a MATLAB implementation of the Kalman Filter, Kalman Smoother, and EM algorithm.

    :T: number of time steps
    :data: observations corresponding to times [1...T]
    :target: true hidden state at times [0...T]
    :A: transition matrix
